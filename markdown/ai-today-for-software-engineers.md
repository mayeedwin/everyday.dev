# Thinking...

> After attending a couple of AI focused sessions at Google I/O Connect 2025, Berlin, here is my reflection so far

Embracing these stages EARLY on has proven right, and to be honest, early adoption has a lot of unknowns but then that's just part of it. Look at mobile phones evolution, how we build apps for the web or mobile, for example - no one had any idea of what best UI/UX would work, too many ideas have evolved over time to incredible experiences we have today.

**That's just it.**

Software Engineering has evolved A LOT as well, from **how we write code**, **manage code**, **share code**, **deploy** and **maintain code**, **devices we write with**, **apps we build** and **platforms we build** for - from **platform specific**, to **hybrid** to **multiplatform**, the growth has been intense and amazing!

Today, with AI, individuals can really focus on what they do best, **INNOVATION.**

I use AI daily. AI has become a companion, a buddy and learning partner, the velocity has been great, easy to build at scale, bug-hunting has become a fun sport; LOL - the learning and relearning is great!

Another key thing to NOTE is that - think of your prompting as a style guide - this is undeniably relative to the skill level of an individual

Don't get me wrong, I **DEBATE** this new found buddy so much, and it's fun! I have deliberately decided to humanize my day-to-day engagement with the AI (Models I use). And this, Oh-my Oh-my, works! Well, at least for ME!

**By the way, I use Claude Code, and Cursor.**

The whole workflow and setup for me in addition to the above is Google Chrome, which also has some cool stuff that allows me to feel in control and really efficient with or without AI.

- [Integrated AI Assistant](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/ai-assistance) - to quickly find and fix bugs - or just get deeper insight about a specific element
- [Workspaces](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/workspaces) - edit, preview your code on the fly
- [Mocking](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/devtools-tips-34) & overriding API requests

There are so many things you could adopt for your workspace and I love how the chrome team has put it [all together here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/).

With every project, task, bug, I have realized that context is KING! Once you contextualize the prompting; refactoring or even just a new feature, the efficiency is unmatched!

In summary, my quick cheat sheet items are;

- Domain knowledge of what you are building
- Have constraints on finger tips
- Best practices are important
- Humanize the prompting

Cheers! Happy & coding!
